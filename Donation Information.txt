I’m placing the reasoning for my donation button in this text document, a totally separate place from any of the places I posted links to download the software.  I did this on purpose.  I don’t want to ‘guilt trip’ anyone into a donation and that only way I can do that is by not providing the reasoning for the donation button anywhere near the downloads of this app.

This software is entirely free.  I enjoy the fact that someone might find it useful more than I enjoy getting any donation.  I did, however, include a donation button.  My girlfriend, who I am having a child with in a few short months, just lost her mother a few weeks back.  She didn’t know I placed a donation button on my application, but any donations made will be given to her.

I will restate, this software is entirely free and there is absolutely no pressure to donate at all.  I realize that this exact tool can be found in various places online, so there’s really no reason to pay for it, but I did my best to include functionality into it that isn’t present in the online tools (such as the tap to set tempo functionality).

Thank you very much,
