1. Changed skewing of slider so that most frequent tempos are in the first half of the slider (1 - 250ish).  This gives the user a bit more accuracy when using these values.

Features to add:

* App Icon
* Tap Tempo Feature from BPM app
* A consistently colored theme (Marble and Grey) (Will need to override look at feel)
* Layout reconfigure
* Consider showing all values at once via a textEditor
* Change to whole BPM values and use modifier buttons to access 1/10th notes (or any other method to access these values
